My name is GianMaria Romanato, I am based in Italy in the nice city of Padua.
I am a seasoned software professional with more than 2 decades of experience.

I am also a proud dad of two kids and a hobbyist mountain-biker.

I started messing around with computers in the late 80's, using a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) with a floppy disk drive, a [dot matrix printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printing) and a [2400 Baud modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem) to connect
to [BBSes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system), often running on another Commodore 64.

I graduated in 2000 in software engineering and since then I have been working
professionally in product development on enterprise-level Web applications.

I am a hands-on guy, and I belive that my low-level experience with hardware and assembly as a kid gave me a
chance to comprehend very well how hardware and software blend together and
allowed me to better understand the evolution of technology in the last 20 years.

Although I never had a chance to professionally work on open source projects, I am a strong believer in open
source. I often contributed to open source projects with bug reports, bug fixes, pull requests, especially on Apache Foundation and Eclipse Foundation projects (because these two organizations host a lot of open source that
I used during my career) and of course also on github. In my limited spare time I participate as an
individual committer to a project hosted at Eclipse Foundation.
My contributions however are limited and always produced late at night or during holidays when not too busy with
work or family matters.
