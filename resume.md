### 2020 to date

Since late 2020 I am CTO with [SIAV](http://siav.it), the leading Italian software provider in the
domain of Content Service Platforms.
I am heading the development of a cloud-native next-generation api-first product built on Java and Angular.

### 2001 to 2020

Earlier, I was CTO with Finantix, a fintech company specialised in wealth management solutions for the biggest
banks in the world.
I worked for Finantix for almost two decades in different roles, starting as a junior developer and then becoming
architect, team leader, development manager and finally serving as CTO since 2013. Unfortunately, traces of Finantix
are quickly disappearing from the Web because it was first acquired by a Private Equity in 2019 and later in 2021 
the Private Equity merged Finantix into [Investcloud](https://www.finantix.com) making it their Private Banking division.

### My approach

While serving as the CTO for Finantix, I modernized the product with a modular micro-services architecture, full
multi-tenancy and advanced customization capabilities such as the possiblity to extend the data model with
custom fields via simple configuration.
I also put a lot of attention into improving processes and largely increased the product quality by applying all
the relevant industry best practices such as Agile processes,
a DevOps culture (Code Review, Static Code Analysis, Security scans, automated API compatibility checks,
self-service automation and more) and eventually embracing containerization and cloud native deployments.

One of the best moments of my career occurrend when after a very detailed and thorough due diligence
ranging from architecture to development processes and from DevOps to security, the Private Equity management
told me that their technicians gave
Finantix the highest score ever among all the companies previously evaluated, which included several major
fintech vendors from all over
the world.

### Education

I got my master's degree in Software Engineering in 2000 from the University of Padua.
