[Originally shared on G+ the 7th of August 2012] <br /><br />For those working with Eclipse on Ubuntu, if you don't like the fact  that the Eclipse menu does not blend into Unity's global menubar, you  may want to try this hack <a class="ot-anchor" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/eclipse/+bug/618587/comments/46">https://bugs.launchpad.net/eclipse/+bug/618587/comments/46</a><br /><br />You  may experience some refresh glitches from time to time, but I  personally prefer the menu to be integrated in Unity, especially because  I use shortcuts way more than the menu.
