Since September 2015 I am a committer of the open source <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/virgo" target="_blank">Eclipse Virgo</a> project.<br /><br />I have written several posts in the past about the Eclipse Virgo OSGi application server, and after having helped the project team with patches and bug fixes I have been invited by <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/author/fwaibel/" target="_blank">Florian</a>, the project lead, to join the team as a committer.<br /><br />I am an individual committer, contributing to the project in my spare time. I spent almost all of my effort on the Virgo Tools, the Eclipse plug-ins that integrate Virgo as a test environment in Eclipse. The most notable improvements of the upcoming version 1.5 of the Virgo tools will be:<br /><ol><li><b>Support for PDE Plug-in projects</b>. This is the possibility to develop for the Virgo runtime using the Eclipse PDE Tools, Plug-in Development Environment. This was one of the most requested and long standing missing features. See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=329198" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.7.0.M01/docs/virgo-tooling-guide/html/ch07.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li><li><b>Improved support for plan projects. </b>Virgo supports deployment of a number of artifacts, including Plans. Plans are XML files listing Bundles and other Plans to be activated. The Virgo Tools now provide fair <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.7.0.M01/docs/virgo-tooling-guide/html/ch08.html" target="_blank">support</a> for having Plan files in Eclipse and deploying them to the test environment.</li><li><b>Bug fixes and documentation</b></li><li><b>Compatibility fixes for Eclipse Neon</b></li></ol>We are currently planning to release the Virgo Tools 1.5 in January 2017 to be shortly followed by Eclipse Virgo 3.7.<br /><br />Stay tuned!<br /><br /><br />
