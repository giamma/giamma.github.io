&nbsp;Today Florian <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1084915/" target="_blank">announced</a> the availability of Virgo 3.7.0.&nbsp;<br /><br />Virgo 3.7.0 brings several <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/virgo/download/release-notes/3.7.0.RELEASE.php" target="_blank">improvements</a> (most notably Tomcat 8.5 and Spring Framework 4.2) and is paired by release 1.5.0 of the Virgo Tools, the Eclipse IDE integration.<br /><br />This is the first official Virgo release since I joined the project as a committer, and it's also my first open source release in general. I am very happy and very proud of what we achieved.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/virgo/download/" target="_blank">Download</a> Virgo and get Virgo Tools from the update <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/virgo/release/tooling/" target="_blank">site</a>!
