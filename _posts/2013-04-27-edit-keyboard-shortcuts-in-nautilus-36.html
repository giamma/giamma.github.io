After upgrading to Ubuntu 13.04, I was a bit annoyed by a short-cut change: I have always used a lot <b>BackSpace</b> in Nautilus to go up one folder. Now, in Nautilus 3.6 this has been changed to <b>ALT-UP</b>.<br /><br />Luckily enough, even if there is no GUI for this, you can change Nautilus key bindings pretty easily.   To change "go up one folder" from ALT-UP to BackSpace, just edit<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">~/.config/nautilus/accels&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br />with your favorite editor (mine is <a href="http://www.geany.org/" target="_blank"><b>geany</b></a>) and add this line at the end:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><span style="font-size: large;">(gtk_accel_path "<actions>/ShellActions/Up" "BackSpace")&nbsp;</actions></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><actions><br /></actions></span><actions>Source: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/1108637</actions>
